""" First script to run to reshape and reindex the raw cytokine concentration
data available as HDF5 files in data/initial/.
The formatted dataframes are then saved in data/final/, also in HDF5 format;
they are used for a few theory applications in this repository.

This script then preprocesses the raw cytokine time series with the steps
described in supplementary information: log-transformation,
smoothing interpolation, and time integration.

Run this script from the top folder in the antigen_encoding_theory repo, i.e.
from the folder antigen_theory_encoding/, which contains the present script.
